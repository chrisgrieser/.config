## Configurations of Interest
Most people tell me they find the following configurations useful:
- [neovim config](/nvim) (5000+ LoC)
- [hammerspoon config](/hammerspoon) (2000+ LoC)
- [.zshrc](/zsh) (1400+ LoC)
- [Pandoc configs & pointers on how to use pandoc](/pandoc)
- [complex modifications for Karabiner Elements](/karabiner)
- [obsidian.vimrc](obsidian-vim/obsidian.vimrc) via the [vimrc Support Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-vimrc-support)

## What are "dotfiles?"
- Read this [primer what dotfiles are](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dotfiles-what-is-a-dot-file-and-how-to-create-it-in-mac-and-linux/).
- Here is an interesting [report on common contents of dotfiles](https://github.com/Kharacternyk/dotcommon).

## How this repository works
- These files are symlinked into iCloud for synchronization.
- Hammerspoon [is configured](hammerspoon/lua/system-and-cron.lua) to run the script [git-dotfile-sync.sh](git-dotfile-sync.sh) every 15 minutes, or on wake and sleep. The Alfred keyword `shutdown` triggers the script before shutting down.
- The git repos that are nested inside this dotfile repository (that is Alfred git repositories, because the nesting cannot be avoided in this case) are gitignored and pulled individually.
- [git-dotfile-backup.sh](git-dotfile-backup.sh) checks whether there have been any changes in dotfiles. If there are, it creates somewhat useful commit messages and runs the `git add commit pull push` sequence.
- [.gitignore](.gitignore) contains a list of files not to backups for several reasons, for example redundancy, privacy, or because they are too big for a git repo.

## About me
In my day job, I am a sociologist studying the social mechanisms underlying the digital economy. For my PhD project, I investigate the governance of the app economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and compatibility.
