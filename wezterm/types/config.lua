---Controls whether the image is repeated in the x-direction:
---
--- - `"Repeat"`: Repeat as much as possible to cover the area.
---             The last image will be clipped if it doesn't fit.
---             This is the default
--- - `"Mirror"`: Like `"Repeat"` except that the image is alternately mirrored which can
---             make images that don't tile seamlessly look a bit better when repeated
--- - `"NoRepeat"`: The image is not repeated
---
---@field repeat_x? "Repeat"|"Mirror"|"NoRepeat"
---Normally, when repeating, the image is tiled based on its width
---such that each copy of the image is immediately adjacent to

---
---You may set `repeat_x_size` to a different value to _increase_
---or _decrease_ the space between the repeated instances:

---
---@field horizontal_offset? number|string
---A number in the range `0.0` through `1.0` inclusive that is multiplied
---with the alpha channel of the source to adjust the opacity of the layer.
---
---The default is `1.0` to use the source alpha channel as-is.
---Using a smaller value makes the layer less opaque/more transparent.
---
---@field opacity? number
---A _hue_, _saturation_ and _brightness_ transformation that can be used
---to adjust those attributes of the layer.
---
---For more information about this kind of transform, see:
--- - [`HsbTransform`](lua://HsbTransform)
---
---@field hsb? HsbTransform
---Controls the height of the image.
---
---The following values are accepted:
---
--- - `"Cover"`: (default) scales the image, preserving aspect ratio, to the smallest
--- -          possible size to fill the viewport, leaving no empty space.
--- -          If the aspect ratio of the viewport differs from the image, the image is cropped
--- - `"Contain"`: Scales the image as large as possible without cropping or stretching.
--- -            If the viewport is larger than the image, tiles the image
--- -            unless `repeat_y` is set to `"NoRepeat"`
--- - `123`: Specifies a height of `123` pixels
--- - `"50%"`: Specifies a size of `50%` of the viewport height
--- - `"2cell"`: Specifies a size equivalent to 2 rows
---
---@field height? "Cover"|"Contain"|number|string

---The default is `true`.
---
---See also [Improved Keyboard Handling in ConPTY](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/main/doc/specs/%234999%20-%20Improved%20keyboard%20handling%20in%20Conpty.md).

---Normally the vertical mouse wheel will scroll the terminal viewport so that
---different sections of the scrollback are visible.
---
---When an application activates the _Alternate Screen Buffer_
---(this is common for "full screen" terminal programs such as pagers and editors),
---the alternate screen doesn't have a scrollback.
---In this mode, if the application hasn't enabled mouse reporting,
---wezterm will generate `Arrow Up` / `Arrow Down` key events
---when the vertical mouse wheel is scrolled.
---
---`config.alternate_buffer_wheel_scroll_speed` specifies how many arrow key presses
---are generated by a single scroll wheel "tick".
---
---The default for this value is `3`, meaning a single _wheel up_ "tick"
---will appear to the application as though the user pressed `Arrow Up`
---three times in quick succession.
---
---@field alternate_buffer_wheel_scroll_speed? integer
---This setting controls the maximum frame rate used when rendering

---
---If you are running with a CPU renderer (e.g. you have
---[`config.front_end`](lua://Config.front_end) set
---to `"Software"`, or your system doesn't have a GPU),
---then setting this option to `1` is recommended,

--- - `"SystemBeep"`: Perform the system beep or alert sound.
---                 This is the default.
---                 On Wayland systems, which have no system beep function,

---The `config.background` option allows you to compose a number of layers
---to produce the background content in the terminal.
---
---Layers can be image files, gradients or solid blocks of color.
---Layers composite over each other based on their alpha channel.
---Images in layers can be made to fill the viewport or to tile, and also
---to scroll with optional parallax as the viewport is scrolled.
---
---This option is a table that lists the desired layers starting with
---the deepest/back-most layer.
---Subsequent layers are composited over the top of preceding layers.
---
---@field background? BackgroundLayer[]
---When `true` (the default), PaletteIndex 0-7 are shifted to **bright**
---when the font intensity is bold.
---
---This brightening effect doesn't occur when the text is set to
---the default foreground color.
---
---This defaults to `true` for better compatibility with software;
---for instance, a lot of software assumes that `Black+Bold` renders
---as a `Dark Grey`, which is legible on a `Black` background,
---but if this option is set to `false`,
---it would render as `Black on Black`.
---
---This option can also have one of three `string` values:
---
--- - `"No"`: The _bold_ attribute will not influence palette selection
--- - `"BrightAndBold"`: The _bold_ attribute will select a bright version
---                    of palette indices (`0-7`) and preserve the _bold_ attribute
---                    on the text, using both a bold font and a brighter color
--- - `"BrightOnly"`: The _bold_ attribute will select a bright version
---                 of palette indices (`0-7`), but the intensity will be
---                 treated as _normal_ and a non-bold font will be used
---                 for the text
---
---You may use `true` or `false` for backwards compatibility.
---`true` is equivalent to `"BrightAndBold"`.
---`false` is equivalent to `"No"`.

---If an application has enabled mouse reporting mode, mouse events are sent directly
---to the application, and do not get routed through the mouse assignment logic.
---
---Holding down the `config.bypass_mouse_reporting_modifiers` modifier key(s)
---will prevent the event from being passed to the application.
---
---The default value for `config.bypass_mouse_reporting_modifiers` is `"SHIFT"`,
---which means that holding down shift while clicking will not send
---the mouse event to e.g. _vim running in mouse mode_
---and will instead treat the event as though `"SHIFT"` was not pressed
---and then match it against the mouse assignments.
---
---@field bypass_mouse_reporting_modifiers? Modifiers
---Controls whether pasted text will have newlines normalized.
---
---If bracketed paste mode is enabled by the application the effective value

---Scales the computed cell width to adjust the spacing
---between successive cells of text.
---
---If possible, you should prefer to specify the stretch parameter
---when selecting a font using either
---[`wezterm.font`](lua://Wezterm.font) or
---[`wezterm.font_with_fallback`](lua://Wezterm.font_with_fallback),
---as that will generally look better and have fewer undesirable side effects.
---
---If your preferred font doesn't have variations with different stretches,
---or if the font spacing still doesn't look right to you,
---then `config.cell_width` gives you a simple way to influence the spacing.
---
---The default cell width is indirectly controlled by the
---[`config.font`](lua://Config.font)
---and [`config.font_size`](lua://Config.font_size)
---configuration options.
---The selected font and font size controls the height of the font,
---while the font designer controls the aspect ratio
---of the glyphs in the font.
---
---The base font (the first font resolved from `config.font`) defines
---the cell metrics for the terminal display grid.
---Those metrics are then then used to place glyphs, regardless of
---which fallback font might be resolved for a given glyph.
---
---If you feel that your chosen font feels too horizontally cramped
---then you can set this to `1.2` to increase
---the horizontal spacing by `20%`.
---Conversely, setting this to `0.9` will decrease
---the horizontal spacing by `10%`.
---
---This option doesn't adjust the rasterized width of glyphs,
---it just changes what wezterm considers to be the cell boundaries.
---When rendering _monospace_, wezterm advances by the cell width to place
---successive glyphs.
---
---If you set the scale less than `1.0` then the glyphs won't be
---truncated or squished, rather they will render on top of each other.
---Conversely, if you set the scale to greater than `1.0`, the glyphs
---won't be stretched but will render further apart from each other.
---
---Changing `config.cell_width` doesn't adjust the positioning of
---the glyph within the cell; it remains at its usual x-position.
---It is not centered within the adjusted space.
---Doing so may have undesirable consequences,
---particularly for fonts that use ligatures.
---
---Depending on the font, you may find that some ligatured sequences are
---misaligned or render strangely.
---**This is not a bug**: the font is designed to be rendered with a
---`config.cell_width` value of `1.0`, so running with a different value
---will have this sort of side effect.
---
---See also:
--- - [`config.line_height`](lua://Config.line_height)
---
---@field cell_width? number
---The character width recommended by the Unicode standard is occasionally
---inconsistent and may not align with linguistic tradition.
---
--- - circled numbers width: ⓪①..⑳㉑
--- - lowercase Roman numerals width: ⅹⅺⅻ
--- - Nerd Font (Private Use Area) character width
--- - ambiguous character width for CJK text
--- - square emojis defined as EAW=Neutral
---
---The `config.cell_widths` configuration parameter allows users
---to override the default character width.
---
---[Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) has square glyphs
---and is an example of half advance width.
---Below is a configuration example that treats these character widths
---as full-width:
---
---```lua
---config.cell_widths = {
---  { first = 0xe000, last = 0xf8ff, width = 2 },
---  { first = 0xf0000, last = 0xf1fff, width = 2 },
---}
---```
---
---This setting takes priority over `config.treat_east_asian_ambiguous_width_as_wide`.
---
---Note that changing this setting may have consequences for layout
---in text UI applications if their expectation of width differs
---from your choice of configuration.
---
---For example, Vim has a built-in function [`setcellwidths()`](https://vimhelp.org/builtin.txt.html#setcellwidths%28%29),
---and shells like Bash or Zsh determine character width
---based on the `glibc` locale.

--- - `stdout`: Specifies where a log of the `stdout` stream from the daemon will be placed.
---           The default is `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wezterm/stdout` on X11/Wayland systems,

---
---You will typically need to launch wezterm directly from another terminal
---to see this logging.
---
---This can be helpful in figuring out how keys are being decoded on your system,
---or for discovering the system-dependent "raw" key code values.
---
---@field debug_key_events? boolean
---Specifies the default cursor style.
---
---Various escape sequences can override the default style
---in different situations (e.g. an editor can change it depending on the mode),
---but this value controls how the cursor appears when it is reset to default.
---
---Acceptable values are:
---
--- - `"SteadyBlock"`
--- - `"BlinkingBlock"`
--- - `"SteadyUnderline"`
--- - `"BlinkingUnderline"`
--- - `"SteadyBar"`
--- - `"BlinkingBar"`
---
---The default is `"SteadyBlock"`.

---
------
---When starting the GUI (not using the serial or connect subcommands),
---by default wezterm will set the built-in `"local"` domain
---as the default multiplexing domain.
---
---The `"local"` domain represents processes that are spawned
---directly on the local system.
---
---Windows users, particularly those who use WSL, may wish to
---override the default domain to instead use a particular
---WSL distribution so that wezterm launches directly
---into a Linux shell rather than having to manually invoke `wsl.exe`.
---Using a
---[`WslDomain`](lua://WslDomain)
---for this has the advantage that wezterm can then use [shell integration](https://wezterm.org/shell-integration.html)
---to track the current directory inside WSL
---and use it when splitting new panes or spawning new tabs.
---
---@field default_domain? string
---When launching the GUI using either `wezterm` or `wezterm-gui`
---(with no subcommand explicitly specified), WezTerm will use
---the value of `config.default_gui_startup_args` to pick
---a default mode for running the GUI.
---
---The default for this config is `{ "start" }` which makes `wezterm`
---with no additional subcommand arguments equivalent to `wezterm start`.
---
---If you always want to use wezterm's ssh client to login to a particular host,
---then you might consider using this configuration:
---
---```lua
---config.default_gui_startup_args = { "ssh", "some-host" }
---```
---
---which will cause `wezterm` with no additional subcommand arguments
---to be equivalent to running `wezterm ssh some-host`.
---
---_Specifying subcommand arguments on the command line is **NOT** additive_
---_with this config; the command line arguments always take precedence._
---
---Depending on your desktop environment, you may find it simpler to use
---your operating system shortcut or alias function to set up a shortcut
---that runs the subcommand you desire.
---
---@field default_gui_startup_args? string[]|{ [1]: "start" }
---**Note: This option only applies to the standalone mux server.**
---
---For the equivalent option in the GUI, see:
--- - [`config.default_domain`](lua://Config.default_domain).
---
--- ---
---When starting the mux server, by default wezterm will set
---the built-in `"local"` domain as the default multiplexing domain.
---The `"local"` domain represents processes that are spawned directly
---on the local system.
---
---This option allows you to change the default domain to some other domain,
---such as an
---[`ExecDomain`](lua://ExecDomain).
---
---It is not possible to configure a client multiplexing domain such as a TLS,
---SSH or UNIX domain as the default for the multiplexer server.
---That is prohibited in order to prevent recursion when a client
---connects to the server.
---
---@field default_mux_server_domain? string
---If no `prog` is specified on the command line, use this
---instead of running the user's shell.
---
---`config.default_prog` is implemented as an array where the 0th element
---is the command to run and the rest of the elements are passed
---as the positional arguments to that command.
---
---@field default_prog? string[]
---Setting this value will cause wezterm to replace the the value of the
---`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment when it first starts up, and to use this value
---for the auth socket registered with the multiplexer server
---(visible via `wezterm cli list-clients`).
---
---You won't normally need to set this, but if you are running
---with an alternative identity agent and want to replace
---the default on your system, this gives you that ability.
---
---@field default_ssh_auth_sock? string
---Specifies the name of the default workspace.
---
---The default value is `"default"`.
---
---@field default_workspace? string|"default"
---When set to `true`, on UNIX systems, for local panes,
---WezTerm will query the _termios_ associated with the PTY to see
---whether local echo is disabled and canonical input is enabled.
---
---If those conditions are met, then the text cursor will be changed
---to a lock to give a visual cue that what you type will not
---be echoed to the screen.
---
---This technique only works for local processes on UNIX systems,
---and will not work through other processes that themselves use PTYs.
---Most notably, this will not work with `tmux` or remote processes
---spawned via `ssh`.
---
---@field detect_password_input? boolean
---@field disable_default_key_bindings? boolean
---If set to `true`, the default mouse assignments will not be used,
---allowing you to tightly control those assignments.
---
---@field disable_default_mouse_bindings? boolean
---When set to `true`, the default set of quick select patterns are omitted, and
---[`config.quick_select_patterns`](lua://Config.quick_select_patterns)
---specifies the total set of patterns used for quick select mode.
---
---Defaults to `false`.
---
---@field disable_default_quick_select_patterns? boolean
---Configures whether subpixel anti-aliasing should produce either
---`"RGB"` or `"BGR"` ordered output.
---
---If your display has a `BGR` pixel geometry then you will want
---to set this to `"BGR"` for the best results
---when using subpixel antialiasing.
---
---The default value is `"RGB"`.
---
---@field display_pixel_geometry? "RGB"|"BGR"
---Override the detected DPI (_dots per inch_) for the display.
---
---This can be useful if the detected DPI is inaccurate and the text
---appears either blurry or too small, particularly
---if you are using a 4K display on X11 or Wayland.
---
---The default value is system specific:
---
-- | OS      | Standard Density        | High Density            |
-- |---------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
-- | macOS   | `72.0`                  | `144.0`                 |
-- | Windows | Probed from the display | Probed from the display |
-- | X11     | `96.0`                  | `96.0`                  |
-- | Wayland | `96.0`                  | `192.0`                 |
---
---In macOS and Wayland environments there isn't strictly
---a system DPI value that can be queried; instead standard density
---has a fixed value and the system will inform WezTerm when the display
---is high density by communicating a scaling factor for the display.
---
---The Wayland protocol only allows for integer scaling factors,
---but some compositors support fractional scaling.
---That fractional scaling can result in blurry text and you may wish
---to specify a DPI value to compensate.
---
---On macOS the scaling factor changes based on the monitor
---on which the window is displayed; dragging the window from a
---retina laptop display to an external standard DPI display
---causes the window to automatically adjust to the DPI scaling.
---
---Microsoft Windows reports the true DPI for the monitor on which
---the window is displayed, and will similarly adjust as the window
---is dragged between monitors.
---
---**DPI is poorly supported by X11 itself**.
---While it is possible to query the displays to determine
---their dimensions, the results are generally inaccurate.
---It is common for X11 environments to publish an `Xft.dpi` value
---as a property of the root window as a hint for the DPI of the display.
---While that is a reasonable workaround for a single-monitor system,
---it isn't ideal for a multi-monitor setup where the monitors have varying DPIs.
---
---@field dpi? integer
---When set to `true`, the [keyboard encoding](https://wezterm.org/config/key-encoding.html) will be changed
---to use the scheme that is [described here](http://www.leonerd.org.uk/hacks/fixterms/).
---
---It is not recommended to enable this option as it does change the behavior
---of some keys in backwards incompatible ways and there isn't a way for applications
---to detect or request this behavior.
---
---The default for this option is `false`.
---
---[`config.allow_win32_input_mode`](lua://Config.allow_win32_input_mode)

---
---@field enable_csi_u_key_encoding? boolean

---Enable the scrollbar.
---
---**This is currently disabled by default.**

---
---For more info read the [`ExecDomain`](https://wezterm.org/config/lua/ExecDomain.html) docs.
---
---@field exec_domains? ExecDomain[]
---Controls the behavior when the shell program spawned by the terminal exits.
---
---There are three possible values:
---
--- - `"Close"`: Close the corresponding pane as soon as the program exits
--- - `"Hold"`: Keep the pane open after the program exits.
---           The pane must be manually closed via [`CloseCurrentPane`](https://wezterm.org/config/lua/keyassignment/CloseCurrentPane.html),
---           [`CloseCurrentTab`](https://wezterm.org/config/lua/keyassignment/CloseCurrentTab.html) or closing the window
--- - `"CloseOnCleanExit"`: if the shell program exited with a successful status,
---                       behave like `"Close"`.
---                       Otherwise, behave like `"Hold"`
---
---Note that most UNIX shells will exit with the status of the last command
---that it ran if you don't specify an exit status.
---
---For example, if you interrupt a command and then use `exit` (with no arguments),
---or `CTRL-D` to send `EOF` to the shell, it will return an unsuccessful exit status.
---The same thing holds if you were to run:
---
---```sh
---$ false
---$ exit
---```
---
---The default is `"Close"`.
---
---For fine tuning what is considered to be a clean exit status, see also:
--- - [`config.clean_exit_codes`](lua://Config.clean_exit_codes)
---
---@field exit_behavior? "Close"|"CloseOnCleanExit"|"Hold"
---Controls how wezterm indicates the exit status of the
---spawned process in a pane when it terminates.
---
---[`config.exit_behavior`](lua://Config.exit_behavior)
---being set to keep the pane open after the process has
---completed, wezterm will display a message to let you know
---that it has finished.
---
---This option controls that message.
---
---It can have one of the following values:
---
--- - `"Verbose"`: Shows 2-3 lines of explanation, including the process name,
---              its exit status and a link to the exit_behavior documentation
--- - `"Brief"`: Like "Verbose", but the link to the documentation is not included
--- - `"Terse"`: A very short indication of the exit status is shown in square brackets
--- - `"None"`: No message is shown
---
---In earlier versions of wezterm, this was not configurable
---and behaved equivalently to the `"Verbose"` setting.
---
---Examples can be found [here](https://wezterm.org/config/lua/config/exit_behavior_messaging.html).
---
---@field exit_behavior_messaging? "Verbose"|"Brief"|"Terse"|"None"
---Configures the font to use by default.
---
---The font setting can specify a set of fallbacks and other options,
---and is described in more detail in the [Fonts section](https://wezterm.org/config/fonts.html).
---
---You will typically use
---[`wezterm.font`](lua://Wezterm.font)
---or [`wezterm.font_with_fallback`](lua://Wezterm.font_with_fallback)
---to specify the font.
---
---@field font? AllFontAttributes
---By default, wezterm will use an appropriate system-specific method
---for locating the fonts that you specify using the options below.
---Additionally, if you configure the `config.font_dirs` option,
---wezterm will load fonts from that set of directories:
---
---```lua
----- This tells wezterm to look first for fonts in the directory named
----- `fonts` that is found alongside your `wezterm.lua` file.
----- As this option is an array, you may list multiple locations if
----- you wish.
---config.font_dirs = { 'fonts' }
---```
---
---`wezterm` will scan the `config.font_dirs` to build a database
---of available fonts.
---When resolving a font, wezterm will first use the configured
---[`config.font_locator`](lua://Config.font_locator),
---which is typically the system specific font resolver.
---If the system doesn't resolve the requested font, the fonts
---from `config.font_dirs` are searched for a match.
---
---If you want to only find fonts from `config.font_dirs`,
---perhaps because you have a self-contained wezterm config
---that you carry around with you between multiple systems
---and don't want to install those fonts on every system that you use,
---then you can set:
---
---```lua
---config.font_locator = 'ConfigDirsOnly'
---```
---
---@field font_dirs? string[]
---Specifies the method by which system fonts are located and loaded.
---You may specify `"ConfigDirsOnly"` to disable loading system fonts
---and use only the fonts found in the directories that you specify in your
---[`config.font_dirs`](lua://Config.font_dirs)
---configuration option.
---
---Otherwise, it is recommended to omit this setting.
---
---@field font_locator? "FontConfig"|"Gdi"|"CoreText"|"ConfigDirsOnly"
---Specifies the method by which fonts are rendered on screen.
---The only available implementation is `"FreeType"`.
---
---@field font_rasterizer? "FreeType"
---When textual output in the terminal is styled with `bold`, `italic`
---or other attributes, wezterm uses `config.font_rules` to decide
---how to render that text.
---
---Most users won't need to specify any explicit value for `config.font_rules`,
---as the defaults should be sufficient.
---
---By default, unstyled text will use the font specified by
---the font configuration, and wezterm will use that as a base,
---and then automatically generate appropriate `config.font_rules`
---that use heavier weight fonts for bold text,
---lighter weight fonts for dim text and italic fonts for italic text.
---
---If you have some unusual fonts or mixtures of fonts
---that you'd like to use, such as using your favourite
---monospace font for the base and a fancy italic font
---from a different font family for italics,
---then `config.font_rules` will allow you to do so.
---
---`config.font_rules` is comprised of a list of rule entries with fields
---that are split into matcher fields and action fields.
---Matcher fields specify which textual attributes you want to match on,
---while action fields specify how you want to render them
---
---If a matcher field is omitted, then the associated attribute
---has no impact on the match: the rule doesn't care about that attribute
---and will match based on the attributes that were listed.
---
---See:
--- - [`FontRules`](lua://FontRules).
---
---@field font_rules? FontRules
---Specifies the method by which text is mapped to glyphs
---in the available fonts.
---
---The shaper is responsible for handling kerning, ligatures
---and emoji composition.
---
---The only option is `"Harfbuzz"`.
---
---@field font_shaper? "Harfbuzz"
---Specifies the size of the font, measured in points.
---
---You may use fractional point sizes, such as `13.3`,
---to fine tune the size.
---
---The default font size is `12.0` points.
---
---@field font_size? number
---When `true` it'll override the `cursor_fg`, `cursor_bg`
---and `cursor_border` settings from the color scheme and
---force the cursor to use reverse video colors based on
---the foreground and background colors.
---
---When `false` (the default), the `cursor_fg`, `cursor_bg`
---and `cursor_border` color scheme settings are applied as normal.
---
---If escape sequences are used to change the cursor color,
---they will take precedence over `config.force_reverse_video_cursor`.
---
---In earlier releases, setting `config.force_reverse_video_cursor`
---to `true` always ignored the configured cursor color.
---
---@field force_reverse_video_cursor? boolean
---Configures a Hue, Saturation, Brightness transformation
---that is applied to monochrome glyphs.
---
---The transform works by converting the `RGB` colors to `HSV` values
---and then multiplying the HSV by the numbers specified
---in `config.foreground_text_hsb`.
---
---Modifying the hue changes the hue of the color by rotating it
---through the color wheel.
---It is not as useful as the other components, but is available
---_"for free"_ as part of the colorspace conversion.
---
---Modifying the saturation can add or reduce
---the amount of "colorfulness".
---Making the value smaller can make it appear more washed out.
---
---Modifying the brightness can be used to dim or increase
---the perceived amount of light.
---
---The range of these values is `0.0` and up; they are used
---to multiply the existing values, so the default of `1.0`
---preserves the existing component, whilst `0.5` will reduce it
---by half, and `2.0` will double the value.
---
---```lua
------This increases color saturation by 50%
---config.foreground_text_hsb = {
---  hue = 1.0,
---  saturation = 1.5,
---  brightness = 1.0,
---}
---```

---@field foreground_text_hsb? HsbTransform
---Selects the freetype interpret version to use.
---
---Likely values are `35`, `38` and `40` which have different
---characteristics with respective to subpixel hinting.
---
---See [Subpixel Hinting](https://freetype.org/freetype2/docs/subpixel-hinting.html).
---
---@field freetype_interpreter_version? integer
---An advanced option to fine tune the freetype rasterizer.
---This is a bitfield, so you can combine one or more of
---these options together, separated by the `|` character,
---although not many of the available options necessarily
---make sense to be combined.
---
---Available flags are:
---
--- - `"DEFAULT"`
--- - `"NO_HINTING"`: Disable hinting.
---                 The freetype documentation says that this generally generates ‘blurrier’
---                 bitmap glyph when the glyph is rendered in any of the anti-aliased modes,
---                 but that was written for rasterizing direct to bitmaps.
---                 In the context of wezterm where we are rasterizing to a texture that is then
---                 sampled and applied to a framebuffer through vertices on the GPU,
---                 the hinting process can be counter-productive and result
---                 in unexpected visual artifacts
--- - `"NO_BITMAP"`: Don't load any pre-rendered bitmap strikes
--- - `"FORCE_AUTOHINT"`: Use the freetype auto-hinter rather than the font's native hinter
--- - `"MONOCHROME"`: Instructs renderer to use 1-bit monochrome rendering.
---                 This option doesn't impact the hinter
--- - `"NO_AUTOHINT"`: Don't use the freetype auto-hinter
---
---```lua
----- You probably don't want to do this, but this demonstrates
----- that the flags can be combined
---config.freetype_load_flags = 'NO_HINTING|MONOCHROME'
---```
---
---The default value depends on the effective DPI of the display.
---If the DPI is `100` or larger, the default value is `"NO_HINTING"`.
---Otherwise, the default value is `"DEFAULT"`.
---
---@field freetype_load_flags? FreeTypeLoadFlags
---Configures the hinting and (potentially) the rendering mode used
---with the freetype rasterizer.
---
---The following values are possible:
---
--- - `"Normal"`: This corresponds to the default hinting algorithm,
---             optimized for standard gray-level rendering.
---             This is the default setting
--- - `"Light"`: A lighter hinting algorithm for non-monochrome modes.
---            Many generated glyphs are more fuzzy but better resemble
---            its original shape.
---            A bit like rendering on Mac OS X
--- - `"Mono"`: Strong hinting algorithm that should only be used
---           for monochrome output.
---           The result is probably unpleasant if the glyph
---           is rendered in non-monochrome modes
--- - `"HorizontalLcd"`: A subpixel-rendering variant of `"Normal"`
---                    optimized for horizontally decimated LCD displays
--- - `"VerticalLcd"`: A subpixel-rendering variant of `"Normal"`
---                  optimized for vertically decimated LCD displays
---
---For more advanced flags that can be primarily used to influence font hinting, see also:
--- - [`config.freetype_render_target`](lua://Config.freetype_render_target)
--- - [`config.freetype_load_flags`](lua://Config.freetype_load_flags)
---
---Note: When using subpixel-rendering, it comes at the cost
---of the ability to explicitly set the alpha channel for the
---text foreground color.
---You will need to choose between using the alpha channel or
---using subpixel-rendering, and you must select subpixel-rendering
---in your main configuration in order for the correct render mode
---to activate: setting it only in a
---[`wezterm.font`](lua://Wezterm.font)
---override is not sufficient.
---
---@field freetype_load_target? "Normal"|"HorizontalLcd"|"Light"|"Mono"|"VerticalLcd"
---This option provides control over the [no-long-family-names](https://freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-properties.html#no-long-family-names)
---FreeType PCF font driver property.
---
---The default is for this configuration to be `false`,
---which sets the PCF driver to use the un-decorated font name.
---This corresponds to the default mode of operation
---of the freetype library.
---
---Some Linux distributions build the freetype library
---in a way that causes the PCF driver to report font names differently;
---instead of reporting just `Terminus` it will prefix the font name with
---the foundry (`xos4` in the case of `Terminus`) and potentially
---append `Wide` to the name if the font has wide glyphs.
---
---The purpose of that configuration option is to disambiguate fonts,
---as there are a number of fonts from different foundries
---that all have the name `Fixed`, and being presented with multiple items
---with the same `Fixed` label is a very ambiguous user experience.
---
---When two different applications have differing values
---for this long family names property, they will face inconsistencies
---in resolving fonts by name as they will disagree on what the name
---of a given PCF font is.
---
---## When should you set this option to true?
---
---If all of the following are `true`, then you should set this option to `true`:
---
--- - You need to use PCF fonts and you need to use fontconfig
---   to resolve their names to font files.
--- - You are using a Linux distribution that builds their FreeType library with
---   `PCF_CONFIG_OPTION_LONG_FAMILY_NAMES` defined.
---
---Note that PCF fonts are a legacy font format and you will be
---better served by OTF, TTF or OTB (Open Type Binary) file formats.
---
---@field freetype_pcf_long_family_names? boolean
---Configures the rendering mode used with the freetype rasterizer.
---
---The default is to use the value of
---[`config.freetype_load_target`](lua://Config.freetype_load_target).
---
---You may wish to override that value if you want very fine control over how
---freetype hints and then renders glyphs.
---
---For example, this configuration uses light hinting but produces subpixel-antialiased glyph bitmaps:
---
---```lua
---config.freetype_load_target = 'Light'
---config.freetype_render_target = 'HorizontalLcd'
---```

---Specify the features to enable when using harfbuzz for font shaping.
---
---There is some light documentation [here](https://harfbuzz.github.io/shaping-opentype-features.html).

---but it boils down to allowing opentype feature names to be specified
---using syntax similar to [the CSS `font-feature-settings` options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-feature-settings).
---
---The _OpenType_ spec lists a number of features [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/featurelist).
---
---This option used to have more scope in earlier versions of wezterm,

---Control IME preedit rendering. IME preedit is an area that is used to display the string being preedited in IME. WezTerm supports the following IME preedit rendering.
---
--- - `"Builtin"`: (Default) IME preedit is rendered by WezTerm itself
---
---`"Builtin"` rendering provides good look and feel for many IMEs,
---rendering the text using the same font as the terminal and works in concert
---with features like [`window:composition_status()`](lua://Window.composition_status).
---It may truncate displaying of IME preedit at the end of window
---if IME preedit is very long because the rendering does not allow the IME preedit
---to overflow the window and does not wrap IME preedit to the next line.
---
--- - `"System"`: IME preedit is rendered by system
---
---`"System"` rendering can be useful to avoid the truncated displaying of IME preedit
---but has a worse look and feel compared to `"Builtin"` rendering.
---
---You can control IME preedit rendering in your configuration file:
---```lua
---config.ime_preedit_rendering = 'System'
---```
---
---Otherwise, the default is `"Builtin"`.
---
---Note:
---
--- - Changing this option usually requires re-launching WezTerm to take full effect.
--- - In macOS, this option has no effect currently.
---   IME preedit is always rendered by WezTerm itself.

---
---The value is a table listing the buttons.
---Each element can have one of the following values:
---
--- - `"Hide"`: The window hide or minimize button

---Controls how keys without an explicit `phys:` or `mapped:` prefix are treated.
---
---If `"Mapped"` (the default), then `mapped:` is assumed.
---Otherwise if `"Physical"` then `phys:` is assumed.
---
---Default key assignments also respect `config.key_map_preference`.
---
---@field key_map_preference? "Mapped"|"Physical"
---See the main [Key Tables docs](https://wezterm.org/config/key-tables.html).

---@field key_tables? table<string, Key[]>
---Holds an array of tables that assign keys to WezTerm.
---
---@field keys? Key[]
---Specify a string of unique characters.
---
---The characters in the string are used to calculate one or two key press
---shortcuts that can be used to quickly choose from the Launcher when in the default mode.
---
---Defaults to: `"1234567890abcdefghilmnopqrstuvwxyz"`
---(Without `j`/`k` so they can be used for movement up and down).
---
---@field launcher_alphabet? string|"1234567890abcdefghilmnopqrstuvwxyz"
---You can define your own entries for the [Launcher Menu](https://wezterm.org/config/launch.html#the-launcher-menu)

---A leader key is a a modal modifier key. If leader is specified in the configuration then pressing
---that key combination will enable a virtual LEADER modifier.
---
---If `config.leader` is specified in the configuration then pressing
---that key combination will enable a virtual `LEADER` modifier.
---
---While `LEADER` is active, only defined key assignments that include `LEADER` in the mods mask
---will be recognized.
---Other keypresses will be swallowed and **NOT** passed through to the terminal.
---
---`LEADER` stays active until a keypress is registered (whether it matches a key binding or not), or
---until it has been active for the duration specified by `timeout_milliseconds`,
---at which point it will automatically cancel itself.

---
---@field leader? LeaderKey
---Scales the computed line height to adjust the spacing between successive rows of text.
---
---The default line height is controlled by
---[`config.font_size`](lua://Config.font_size).
---
---If you feel that your chosen font feels too vertically cramped then you can set
---`config.line_height = 1.2` to increase the vertical spacing by 20%.
---Conversely, setting `config.line_height = 0.9` will decrease the vertical spacing by 10%.
---
---@field line_height? number
---When set to `true`, WezTerm will log warnings when it receives escape sequences
---which it does not understand.
---Those warnings are harmless and are useful primarily by the maintainer
---to discover new and interesting escape sequences.
---
---@field log_unknown_escape_sequences? boolean
---On macOS systems, this option controls whether modified key presses are routed
---via the IME when setting `true` to
---[`config.use_ime`](lua://Config.use_ime).
---
---When processing a key event, if any modifiers are held,
---if the modifiers intersect with the value of `config.macos_forward_to_ime_modifier_mask`,
---then the key event is routed to the IME, which may choose to swallow the key event
---as part of its own state management.
---
---Users of a Japanese IME may wish to set this to `"SHIFT|CTRL"`,
---but should note that it will prevent certain `CTRL` key combinations
---that are commonly used in UNIX terminal programs from working as expected.
---
---@field macos_forward_to_ime_modifier_mask? Modifiers
---When `true` and in full screen mode, the window will extend behind the notch on macOS.
---
---The default value for `config.macos_fullscreen_extend_behind_notch` is `false`.
---
---Must be used with a `false` value for
---[`config.native_macos_fullscreen_mode`](lua://Config.native_macos_fullscreen_mode).
---
---Toggling full screen with the native macOS full screen button
---or a window manager command won't have any effect and you must use the
---`"Toggle full screen mode"` button in `View > Toggle` full screen mode
---or configure your own key, see `ToggleFullScreen`.
---
---Example config:

---```lua
---config.native_macos_fullscreen_mode = false
---config.macos_fullscreen_extend_behind_notch = true
---```
---
---@field macos_fullscreen_extend_behind_notch? boolean
---Combined with [`config.window_background_opacity`](lua://Config.window_background_opacity)
---will configure the blur radius amount used by macOS when compositing the window on the screen.

---This can be used to produce a translucent window effect rather than a crystal clear
---transparent window effect.
---
---The default value is `0`.
---
---@field macos_window_background_blur? integer
---Limits the maximum number of frames per second that wezterm will attempt to draw.
---
---Defaults to `60`.
---
---Note that for Wayland this is ignored, instead will use information
---from the compositor to schedule painting frames.
---
---@field max_fps? integer
---Controls the minimum size of the scroll bar "thumb".
---
--The value can be a number to specify the number of pixels, or a string with a unit suffix:
---
--- - `"1px"`: The `px` suffix indicates pixels, so this represents a 1 pixel value
--- - `"1pt"`: The `pt` suffix indicates points.
---          There are 72 points in 1 inch.
---          The actual size this occupies on screen depends on the DPI of the display device
--- - `"1cell"`: The `cell` suffix indicates the height of the terminal cell,
---            which in turn depends on the font size, font scaling and DPI
--- - `"1%"`: The `%` suffix indicates the size of the terminal portion of the display,
---         which is computed based on the number of rows and the size of the cell
---
---You may use a fractional number such as `"0.5cell"`
---or numbers larger than one such as `"72pt"`.
---
---@field min_scroll_bar_height? string
---A list containing tables of type
---[`MouseBindingBase`](lua://MouseBindingBase).

---@field mouse_bindings? MouseBindingBase[]
---If `true`, the vertical mouse wheel will switch between tabs
---when the mouse cursor is over the tab bar.
---
---The default is `true`.
---Set to `false` to disable this behavior.
---
---@field mouse_wheel_scrolls_tabs? boolean
---When set to `true` (the default), wezterm will configure the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable
---for panes spawned in the `local` domain.
---
---The auth sock will point to a symbolic link that will in turn be pointed to the authentication socket
---associated with the most recently active multiplexer client.
---
---You can review the authentication socket that will be used for various clients
---by running `wezterm cli list-clients` and inspecting the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` column.
---
---The symlink is updated within (at the time of writing this documentation) 100ms
---of the active Mux client changing.
---
---You can set `config.mux_enable_ssh_agent` to `false` to prevent wezterm from assigning `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`
---or updating the symlink.
---
---@field mux_enable_ssh_agent? boolean
---Specifies a list of environment variables that should be removed from the environment
---in the multiplexer server.
---
---The intent is to clean up environment variables that might give the wrong impression
---of their operating environment to the various terminal sessions spawned by the multiplexer server.
---
---The default value for this is:
---
---```lua
---config.mux_env_remove = {
---  'SSH_AUTH_SOCK',
---  'SSH_CLIENT',
---  'SSH_CONNECTION',
---}
---```
---
---@field mux_env_remove? string[]
---Specifies whether the [`ToggleFullScreen`](https://wezterm.org/config/lua/keyassignment/ToggleFullScreen.html) key assignment
---uses the native macOS full-screen application support or not.
---
---The default is `false` which will simply (and very quickly) toggle between a window
---that covers the full screen, with no decorations and a regularly sized window.
---
---When `true`, transitioning to full screen will use the macOS native full screen mode,
---which in more recent versions of macOS, will allocate a separate Space for the wezterm application
---and then slowly animate the wezterm window moving into to that full screen Space on the monitor.
---
---This option only has an effect when running on macOS.
---
---@field native_macos_fullscreen_mode? boolean
---When set to `true`, contiguous runs codepoints output to the terminal
---are normalized to Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC).
---
---This can improve the display of text and in the terminal
---when portions of the output are in other normalization forms,
---particularly with Korean text where
---a given glyph can be comprised of several codepoints.
---
---However, depending on the application running inside the terminal,
---enabling this option may introduce discrepancies in the understanding of text positioning:
---while it may fix some display glitches for some applications,
---it may trade them for other glitches.
---**As such, you should consider this configuration setting to be an imperfect option.**
---
---This option defaults to `false` as it introduces some additional text processing
---that is not necessary for most users.
---
---@field normalize_output_to_unicode_nfc? boolean
---This option controls how wezterm behaves when a toast notification escape sequence is received.
---
---The following escape sequences will generate a toast notification:
---
---```sh
---printf "\e]777;notify;%s;%s\e\\" "title" "body"
---printf "\e]9;%s\e\\" "hello there"
---```
---
---@field notification_handling? NotifyHandler
---When `true`, moving the mouse pointer over an inactive pane will cause that pane to activate;
---this behavior is known as "focus follows mouse".
---
---When `false` (the default), you need to click on an inactive pane to activate it.
---
---@field pane_focus_follows_mouse? boolean
---Configures the font to use for pane selection mode.
---
---The `config.pane_select_font` setting can specify a set of fallbacks and other options,
---and is described in more detail in the [Fonts section](https://wezterm.org/config/fonts.html).
---
---If not specified, the font is same as the font
---for [`config.window_frame.font`](lua://WindowFrameConfig.font).
---
---Typically either [`wezterm.font`](lua://Wezterm.font) or
---[`wezterm.font_with_fallback`](lua://Wezterm.font_with_fallback) are
---used to specify the font.
---
---An example:
---
---```lua
---config.pane_select_font = wezterm.font 'Roboto'
---```
---
---@field pane_select_font? AllFontAttributes
---If non-zero, specifies the period (in seconds) at which various statistics are logged.
---
---Note that there is a minimum period of 10 seconds.
---
---@field periodic_stat_logging? integer
---Depending on the OS and windowing environment, there are a number of different ways
---to access the GPU.
---
---This option controls whether wezterm should attempt to use EGL to configure the GPU.
---
---The default is `true`.
---
---@field prefer_egl? boolean
---If set to `true`, launching a new instance of wezterm will prefer to spawn
---a new tab when it is able to connect to your already-running GUI instance.
---Otherwise, it will spawn a new window.
---
---The default value for this option is `false`.
---
---@field prefer_to_spawn_tabs? boolean
---Specify the alphabet used to produce labels for the items matched in quick select mode.
---
---The default alphabet is `"asdfqwerzxcvjklmiuopghtybn"` which means that
---the first matching item from the bottom is labelled with an `a`,
---the second with `s` and so forth;
---these are easily accessible characters in a `qwerty` keyboard layout.
---
-- |          |                                        |
-- |----------|----------------------------------------|
-- | `qwerty`   | `"asdfqwerzxcvjklmiuopghtybn"` (default) |
-- | `qwertz`   | `"asdfqweryxcvjkluiopmghtzbn"`           |

-- | `colemak`  | `"arstqwfpzxcvneioluymdhgjbk"`           |
---
---The suggested alphabet in the above table uses the left 4 fingers
---on the home row, top row, bottom row, then the right 4 fingers
---on the home raw, top row, bottom row, followed by the characters
---in the middle of the keyboard that may be harder to reach.
---
---@field quick_select_alphabet? QuickSelectAlphabet
---Specify additional patterns to match when in quick select mode.
---
---This setting is a table listing out a set of regular expressions.

---The regex syntax now supports backreferences and look around assertions.
---See [Fancy Regex Syntax](https://docs.rs/fancy-regex/latest/fancy_regex/#syntax) for the extended syntax,
---which builds atop the underlying [Regex syntax](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax).
---
---@field quick_select_patterns? string[]
---When set to `true`, all color and styling is removed from the pane
---prior to performing matching and highlighting any matching text
---in quick select mode.
---
---This can make it easier to focus on the matches, particularly when the pane
---already had a lot of styling and colors.
---
---Defaults to `false`.
---
---@field quick_select_remove_styling? boolean
---When set to `true`, wezterm will terminate when all windows are closed.
---This is the default behavior.
---
---When set to `false`, wezterm will continue running.
---
---@field quit_when_all_windows_are_closed? boolean
---Controls how file names are quoted (or not) when dragging and dropping. There are five possible values:
---
--- - `"None"`: No quoting is performed, the file name is passed through as-is
--- - `"Posix"`: Use POSIX style shell word escaping
--- - `"SpacesOnly"`: Backslash-escape only spaces, leaving all other characters as-is.
---                 This is the default for non-Windows platforms
--- - `"Windows"`: Use Windows style shell word escaping: double-quote filename
---              with space characters in it, and leaving others as-is.
---              This is the default on Windows
--- - `"WindowsAlwaysQuoted"`: Like `"Windows"`, while always double-quoting the filename
---
---@field quote_dropped_files? DroppedFileQuoting
---The minimum contrast ratio required to use the reverse video cursor.
---
---When the contrast ratio between the reverse video cursor foreground and background

---will be used instead.
---
---@field reverse_video_cursor_min_contrast? number
---If `false`, do not scroll to the bottom of the terminal when

---
---The default is to scroll to the bottom when you send input
---to the terminal (`true`).
---
---@field scroll_to_bottom_on_input? boolean
---How many lines of scrollback you want to retain.
---
---@field scrollback_lines? number
---Configures the boundaries of a word, thus what is selected when doing a word selection with the mouse.
---(See mouse actions [`SelectTextAtMouseCursor`](https://wezterm.org/config/lua/keyassignment/SelectTextAtMouseCursor.html)
---and [`ExtendSelectionToMouseCursor`](https://wezterm.org/config/lua/keyassignment/ExtendSelectionToMouseCursor.html) with the mode argument set to `Word`).
---
---Defaults to `" \t\n{}[]()\"'`"`.
---
---For example, to always include spaces and newline when selecting a word,
---but stop on punctuations:
---
---```lua
---config.selection_word_boundary = '{}[]()"\'`.,;:'

---
---@field selection_word_boundary? string
---Define a list of serial port(s) that you use regularly.
---Each entry defines
---a [`SerialDomain`](lua://SerialDomain)
---table with the following fields:
---
--- - `name`: The name to use for the serial domain.
---         Must be unique across all multiplexer domains in your configuration
--- - `port`: The name of the serial device.
---         On Windows systems this can be a name like `COM0`.
---         On Posix systems this will be a device path something like `/dev/ttyUSB0`.
---         If omitted, the name field be interpreted as the port name
--- - `baud`: The communication speed to assign to the port.
---         If omitted, the default baud rate will be `9600`
---
---The following configuration example defines a single port:
---
---```lua
---config.serial_ports = {
---  {
---    name = '/dev/tty.usbserial-10',
---    baud = 115200,
---  },

---This is not used when working with remote domains.
---
---@field set_environment_variables? table<string, string>
---When set to `false`, the close-tab button will not be drawn in tabs
---when the fancy tab bar is in use.
---
---Default is `true`.

---@field show_close_tab_button_in_tabs? boolean
---When set to `true` (the default), the tab bar will display the `new-tab` button,
---which can be left-clicked to create a new tab,
---or right-clicked to display the Launcher Menu.
---
---When set to `false`, the new-tab button will not be drawn into the tab bar.
---
---@field show_new_tab_button_in_tab_bar? boolean
---When set to `true` (the default), tab titles show their tab number (tab index)
---with a prefix such as `1:`.
---
---When `false`, no numeric prefix is shown.
---
---The [`config.tab_and_split_indices_are_zero_based`](lua://Config.tab_and_split_indices_are_zero_based)
---setting controls whether numbering starts with `0` or `1`.
---
---@field show_tab_index_in_tab_bar? boolean

---associated with the current window.
---
---When set to `false`, the tabs will not be drawn into the tab bar.
---
---@field show_tabs_in_tab_bar? boolean
---This option no longer has any effect and will be removed in a future release.
---
---@field show_update_window? boolean
---This configuration specifies a list of process names that are considered to be "stateless"
---and that are safe to close without prompting when closing windows, panes or tabs.
---
---When closing a pane, WezTerm will try to determine the processes
---that were spawned by the program that was started in the pane.
---If all of those process names match one of the names in the
---`config.skip_close_confirmation_for_processes_named` list then it will not
---prompt for closing that particular pane.

--- - `"Ssh2"`: Use `libssh2`
--- - `"LibSsh"`: Use `libssh`
---
---Despite the naming, `libssh2` is not a newer version of `libssh`.
---They are completely separate ssh implementations.

---This config option accepts different units that have slightly different interpretations:
---
--- - `2`, `2.0` or `"2px"` all specify a position of 2 pixels
--- - `"2pt"` specifies a position of 2 points, which scales according to the DPI of the window
--- - `"200%"` takes the font-specified underline_position and multiplies it by `2`
--- - `"0.5cell"` takes the cell height, scales it by `0.5` and uses that as the position
---
---@field strikethrough_position? string|number
---When set to `true`, clicking on a pane will focus it.
---When set to `false` (the default), clicking on a pane will focus it and then pass
---the click through to the application in the terminal.
---
---@field swallow_mouse_click_on_pane_focus? boolean
---When set to `true`, clicking on a wezterm window will focus it.
---
---When set to `false`, clicking on a wezterm window will focus it and then pass through
---the click to the pane where the
---[`config.swallow_mouse_click_on_pane_focus`](lua://Config.swallow_mouse_click_on_pane_focus)
---option will further modify mouse event processing.
---
---The default is `true` on macOS. Otherwise it will default to `false`.
---
---@field swallow_mouse_click_on_window_focus? boolean
---If `true`, the `Backspace` and `Delete` keys generate `Delete` and `Backspace`
---keypresses, respectively, rather than their normal keycodes.
---
---On macOS the default for this is `true` because its `Backspace` key
---is labeled as `Delete` and things are backwards.
---
---@field swap_backspace_and_delete? boolean
---If set to `true`, when the active tab is closed, the previously activated tab
---will be activated.
---Otherwise, the tab to the left of the active tab will be activated.

---If `true`,
---[`config.show_tab_index_in_tab_bar`](lua://Config.show_tab_index_in_tab_bar)
---will use a zero-based index.
---
---The default is `false`, so the tab will show a one-based index.
---
---@field tab_and_split_indices_are_zero_based? boolean
---When `true`, the tab bar will be rendered at the bottom of the window
---rather than the top of the window.
---
---The default is `false`.
---
---@field tab_bar_at_bottom? boolean
---This config option allows styling the elements that appear in the tab bar.
---This configuration supplements the tab bar color options.
---
---Styling in this context refers to how the edges of the tabs
---and the new tab button are rendered.
---The default is simply a space character but you can use any sequence of
---formatted text produced by
---[`wezterm.format`](lua://Wezterm.format).
---
---The defaults for each of these styles is simply a space.
---For each element, the foreground and background colors are set
---as per the tab bar colors you've configured.
---
---The available elements are:
---
--- - `active_tab_left`/`active_tab_right`: The left and right sides of the active tab
--- - `inactive_tab_left`/`inactive_tab_right`: The left and right sides of inactive tabs
--- - `inactive_tab_hover_left`/`inactive_tab_hover_right`: The left and right sides of inactive tabs
---                                                     in the hover state
--- - `new_tab_left`/`new_tab_right`: The left and right sides of the new tab button (`+`)

--- - `window_hide`/`window_hide_hover`: The minimize/hide button
--- - `window_maximize`/`window_maximize_hover`: The maximize button
--- - `window_close`/`window_close_hover`: The close button
---
---@field tab_bar_style? TabBarStyle
---Specifies the maximum width that a tab can have in the tab bar
---when using retro tab mode.
---
---This is ignored when using fancy tab mode.
---
---Defaults to `16` glyphs in width.
---
---@field tab_max_width? number
---What to set the `TERM` variable to.
---
---@field term? string
---Specifies the
---[`EasingFunction`](lua://EasingFunction)
---to use when computing the color for text that has the blinking attribute
---in the fading-in phase when the text is fading from the background color
---to the foreground color.
---
---See:

---   for more information about easing functions
--- - [`config.cursor_blink_rate`](lua://Config.cursor_blink_rate)
---   to control the rate at which the cursor blinks
---
---@field text_blink_ease_in? EasingFunction
---Specifies the easing function to use when computing the color

---when the text is fading from the foreground color to the background color.
---
---See:
--- - [`config.visual_bell`](lua://Config.visual_bell)

---from the background color to the foreground color.
---
---See:
--- - [`config.visual_bell`](lua://Config.visual_bell)

---
---See:
--- - [`config.visual_bell`](lua://Config.visual_bell)
---   for more information about easing functions
---
---@field text_blink_rapid_ease_out? EasingFunction
---Specifies how often blinking text (normal speed) transitions between
---_visible_ and _invisible_, expressed in milliseconds.
---
---Setting this to `0` disables slow text blinking.
---
---Note that this value is approximate due to the way that the system event loop
---schedulers manage timers.
---Non-zero values will be at least the interval specified with some degree of slop.
---
---@field text_blink_rate? integer
---Specifies how often blinking text (rapid speed) transitions
---between visible and invisible, expressed in milliseconds.
---
---Setting this to `0` disables rapid text blinking.
---
---Note that this value is approximate due to the way
---that the system event loop schedulers manage timers;
---non-zero values will be at least the interval specified
---with some degree of slop.
---
--- ---
---Note that blinking is no longer a binary blink, but rather
---it interpolates between invisible and visible text using
---an easing function.
---
---For more information, see:

--- - [`config.text_blink_rapid_ease_out`](lua://Config.text_blink_rapid_ease_out)
---
---@field text_blink_rate_rapid? integer
---An optional floating point value that defaults to `nil`.
---
---When set, it defines the minimum contrast ratio between
---the foreground and background color of a textual cell,
---when the cell has differing foreground and background colors.
---
---If the color attributes of a cell fall below the minimum contrast ratio,
---then the foreground color will have its luminance (perceived brightness)
---adjusted to try to boost the contrast ratio to meet the specified minimum.
---
---This may cause the foreground color to either increase or decrease
---in luminance, typically making it either more white or more black.
---
---It may not be possible to achieve the requested minimum ratio,
---in which case a slightly better or the original color
---(if no better color can be computed) will be used.
---
---If the foreground and background colors in a cell are identical,
---then that is assumed to be deliberate and the colors will remain
---unchanged by this setting.
---
---WCAG 2.0 level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text,
---so setting `config.text_min_contrast_ratio` to `4.5` is a reasonable value
---if you find that your selected color scheme has poor contrast
---in the applications that you run in your terminal.
---
---@field text_min_contrast_ratio? number|nil
---Contains a list of Window Environments that are known to be tiling window managers.
---
---A tiling window manager is one that automatically resizes windows
---according to some layout policy, rather than respecting the window size
---set by an application.
---
---The default value for this option is:
---
---```lua
---config.tiling_desktop_environments = {
---  'X11 LG3D',
---  'X11 bspwm',
---  'X11 i3',
---  'X11 dwm',
---}
---```
---
---The following additional entries are now part of the default value of
---`config.tiling_desktop_environments`:
---
--- - '"X11 awesome"'
---
---The environment name can be found in the debug overlay which you can show via
---the [`ShowDebugOverlay`](https://wezterm.org/config/lua/keyassignment/ShowDebugOverlay.html) key assignment.
---
---The default key binding for it is `Ctrl+Shift+L`.
---
---Look for the line beginning with `Window Environment:`.
---The text after the colon is the name to add to `config.tiling_desktop_environments`.
---
---If your window environment is a tiling environment and is not listed here,
---please file an Issue or a Pull Request upstream to add it to the default list.
---
---The contents of this list are used to determine a reasonable default for the
---[`config.adjust_window_size_when_changing_font_size`](lua://Config.adjust_window_size_when_changing_font_size)
---configuration field.

---Unicode defines a number of codepoints as having [Ambiguous Width](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/#Ambiguous).
---These are characters whose width resolves differently according to
---context that is typically absent from the monospaced world
---of the terminal.
---
---WezTerm will by default treat ambiguous width as occupying a single cell.
---
---When `true`, WezTerm will treat them as being two cells wide.
---
---Note that changing this setting may have consequences for layout
---in text UI applications if their expectation of width differs from
---your choice of configuration.
---
---@field treat_east_asian_ambiguous_width_as_wide? boolean
---If you are using a layout with an `AltGr` key, you may experience issues
---when running inside a VNC session, because VNC emulates the `AltGr` keypresses
---by sending plain `Ctrl-Alt` keys, which won't be understood as `AltGr`.
---
---To fix this behavior you can tell WezTerm to treat `Left-Ctrl-Alt` keys
---as `AltGr` with the `config.treat_left_ctrlalt_as_altgr` option.
---
---Note that the key bindings using separate `Ctrl` and `Alt`
---won't be triggered anymore.
---
---@field treat_left_ctrlalt_as_altgr? boolean
---Controls how keyboard shortcuts are rendered in the Command Palette.
---
---Possible values are:
---
--- - `"UnixLong"`: `Super`, `Meta`, `Ctrl`, `Shift`
--- - `"Emacs"`: `Super`, `M`, `C`, `S`
--- - `"AppleSymbols"`: Use macOS style symbols for `Command`, `Option` and so on
--- - `"WindowsLong"`: `Win`, `Alt`, `Ctrl`, `Shift`
--- - `"WindowsSymbols"`: Like `"WindowsLong"` but using a logo for the `Win` key
---
---The default is the platform-appropriate value.
---
---@field ui_key_cap_rendering? "AppleSymbols"|"Emacs"|"UnixLong"|"WindowsLong"|"WindowsSymbols"
---On UNIX systems, specifies the minimum desirable value for the
---`RLIMIT_NOFILE` soft limit.
---
---That system parameter controls the maximum number of file descriptors
---that a given process is permitted to open.
---
---On startup, wezterm will inspect the soft and hard limits,
---and if the soft limit is below the value of the `config.ulimit_nofile` option,
---wezterm will attempt to raise it to `min(ulimit_nofile, hard_limit)`.
---
---@field ulimit_nofile? integer
---On UNIX systems, specifies the minimum desirable value for the
---`RLIMIT_NPROC` soft limit.
---
---That system parameter controls the maximum number of
---simultaneous processes that a given user is permitted to spawn.
---
---On startup, wezterm will inspect the soft and hard limits,
---and if the soft limit is below the value of `config.ulimit_nproc`,
---wezterm will attempt to raise it to `min(ulimit_nproc, hard_limit)`.
---
---@field ulimit_nproc? integer
---If specified, overrides the position of underlines.
---
---The default is to use the underline position metric specified
---by the designer of the primary font.
---
---This config option accepts different units that have
---slightly different interpretations:
---
--- - `2`, `2.0` or `"2px"` all specify a position of 2 pixels
--- - `"2pt"` specifies a position of 2 points, which scales according to the DPI of the window
--- - `"200%"` takes the font-specified `underline_position` and multiplies it by `2`
--- - `"0.1cell"` takes the cell height, scales it by `0.1` and uses that as the position
---
---Note that `config.underline_position` is often a small negative number
---like `-2` or `-4` which specifies an offset from the baseline of the font.
---
---@field underline_position? string|number
---If specified, overrides the base thickness of underlines.
---
---The underline thickness is also used for rendering split pane dividers
---and a number of other lines in custom glyphs.
---
---The default is to use the underline thickness metric specified
---by the designer of the primary font.
---
---This config option accepts different units that have
---slightly different interpretations:
---
--- - `2`, `2.0` or `"2px"` all specify a thickness of 2 pixels
--- - `"2pt"` specifies a thickness of 2 points, which scales according to the DPI of the window
--- - `"200%"` takes the font-specified `underline_thickness` and multiplies it by 2
---          to arrive at a thickness double the normal size
--- - `"0.1cell" takes the cell height, scales it by `0.1`` and uses that as the thickness
---
---@field underline_thickness? string|number
---Specifies the version of unicode that will be used when interpreting
---the width/presentation of text.
---
---This option exists because Unicode is an evolving specification which
---introduces new features and that occasionally adjusts how existing features
---should be handled.
---
---For example, there were a number of unicode code points that had
---their width changed between Unicode version `8` and version `9`.
---This wouldn't be an issue if all software was simultaneously aware of the change,
---but the reality is that there is a lot of older software out there,
---and that even if your local system is fully up to date,
---you might connect to a remote system via SSH that is running applications
---that use a different version of unicode than your local system.
---
---The impact of mismatching expectations of unicode width for a
---terminal emulator is that text columns may no longer line up
---as the application author expected, and/or that the cursor
---may appear to be in the wrong place when editing lines or text
---in shells or text editors.
---
---`config.unicode_version` defaults to unicode version `9` as that is
---the most widely used version (from the perspective of width) as of writing,
---which means that the default experience has the lowest chance
---of mismatched expectations.
---
---More info can be found [here](https://wezterm.org/config/lua/config/unicode_version.html).

---If set to `false`, the [`ActivatePaneDirection`](https://wezterm.org/config/lua/keyassignment/ActivatePaneDirection.html) command
---will have no effect if the active pane is zoomed.
---
---If `true`, the active pane will be unzoomed first and then switched.
---
---See also [`TogglePaneZoomState`](https://wezterm.org/config/lua/keyassignment/TogglePaneZoomState.html).
---
---@field unzoom_on_switch_pane? boolean
---When set to `true`, use the cap-height font metrics of the base
---and the current font to adjust the size of secondary fonts
---(such as bold or italic faces) to visually match the size
---of the base font.
---
---The default is `false`.
---
---@field use_cap_height_to_scale_fallback_fonts? boolean
---By default, if you are using a layout with dead keys
---(e.g. US International or a number of European layouts),
---pressing a dead key in wezterm will "hold" the dead key
---until the next character is pressed, resulting in a
---combined character with a diacritic.
---For example, pressing `^` and then e will produce `ê`.
---Pressing `^` then `SPACE` will produce `^` on its own.
---
---If you are a heavy user of Vi style editors then you may
---wish to disable dead key processing so that `^` can be used
---with a single keypress.
---
---You can tell WezTerm to disable dead keys by setting this
---in your configuration file:
---
---```lua
---config.use_dead_keys = false
---```
---
---Note that for X11 systems that use a `true` value for
---[`config.use_ime`](lua://Config.use_ime),
---depending on the configured IME, the IME may handle
---dead key processing implicitly.
---There is no way for WezTerm to prevent it from doing that,
---short of disabling the IME.
---
---@field use_dead_keys? boolean
---When set to `true` (the default), the tab bar is rendered
---in a native style with proportional fonts.
---
---When set to `false`, the tab bar is rendered using a retro aesthetic
---using the main terminal font.
---
---@field use_fancy_tab_bar? boolean
---Controls whether the Input Method Editor (IME) will be used
---to process keyboard input.
---
---The IME is useful for inputting kanji or other text that
---isn't natively supported by the attached keyboard hardware.
---
---More info can be found [here](https://wezterm.org/config/lua/config/use_ime.html).
---
---@field use_ime? boolean
---When set to `true`, prefer to snap the window size to a
---multiple of the terminal cell size.
---The default is `false`, which allows sizing the window
---to an arbitrary size.
---
---This option is only respected on X11, Wayland, Windows and macOS.
---
---Note that if you have
---[`config.window_padding`](lua://Config.window_padding)
---configured then the resize increments
---don't take the padding into account.
---
---@field use_resize_increments? boolean
---When the `BEL` ASCII sequence is sent to a pane,
---the bell is "rung" in that pane.
---
---You may choose to configure the `config.visual_bell` option
---to show a visible representation of the bell event, by having
---the background color of the pane briefly change color.
---
---There are four fields to the `config.visual_bell` config option:
---
--- -`fade_in_duration_ms`: How long it should take for the bell color to fade in,
---                       in milliseconds.
---                       The default is `0`
--- -`fade_out_duration_ms`: How long it should take for the bell color to fade out,
---                        in milliseconds.
---                        The default is `0`
--- -`fade_in_function`: An easing function, similar to CSS easing functions,
---                    that affects how the bell color is faded in
--- -`fade_out_function`: An easing function that affects how the bell color is faded out
--- -`target`: Can be `"BackgroundColor"` (the default) to have the background color
---          of the terminal change when the bell is rung,
---          or `"CursorColor"` to have the cursor color change when the bell is rung
---
---If the total fade in and out durations are `0`, then there will be
---no visual bell indication.
---
---The bell color is itself specified in your color settings;
---if not specified, the text foreground color will be used.
---
---The following easing functions are supported:
---
--- - `"Linear"`: The fade happens at a constant rate
--- - `"Ease"`: The fade starts slowly, accelerates sharply, and then
---           slows gradually towards the end.
---           This is the default
--- - `"EaseIn"`: The fade starts slowly, and then progressively
---             speeds up until the end, at which point it stops abruptly
--- - `"EaseInOut"`: The fade starts slowly, speeds up, and then slows down
---                towards the end
--- - `"EaseOut"`: The fade starts abruptly, and then progressively
---              slows down towards the end
--- - `{ CubicBezier = { 0.0, 0.0, 0.58, 1.0 } }`: An arbitrary cubic bezier
---                                              with the specified parameters
--- - `"Constant"`: Evaluates as `0` regardless of time.
---               Useful to implement a step transition at the end of the duration

---When set to `true`, if a glyph cannot be found for a given codepoint,
---then the configuration error window will be shown with a pointer
---to the font configuration docs.
---
---You can set this to `false` to prevent the configuration error window
---from being displayed.
---
---The default is `true`.
---
---@field warn_about_missing_glyphs? boolean
---If set to `true`, forces the use of a fallback software (CPU based)
---rendering backend.
---The performance will not be as good as using a GPU.
---
---This option is only applicable when you have set `"WebGpu"` for
---[`config.front_end`](lua://Config.front_end).
---
---A more fine grained control over which GPU is selected also relies on
---[`config.webgpu_preferred_adapter`](lua://Config.webgpu_preferred_adapter).
---
---@field webgpu_force_fallback_adapter? boolean
---Whether to select the higher powered discrete GPU when the system has
---a choice of _integrated_ or _discrete_.
---
---Defaults to `"LowPower"`.
---
---@field webgpu_power_preference? "LowPower"|"HighPerformance"
---Specifies which `WebGpu` adapter should be used.
---
---This option is only applicable when you have set `"WebGpu"` to
---[`config.front_end`](lua://Config.front_end).
---
---To return a list of GPUs, you can use
---[`wezterm.gui.enumerate_gpus()`](lua://Wezterm.Gui.enumerate_gpus).

---When combined with
---[`config.win32_system_backdrop`](lua://Config.win32_system_backdrop)
---as `"Acrylic"` on Windows systems, this option specifies

---Dynamically generates a
---[`config.window_background_image`](lua://Config.window_background_image)
---from the provided gradient specification.
---
---When `config.window_background_gradient` is configured,
---wezterm will ignore the value of
---[`config.window_background_image`](lua://Config.window_background_image).
---
---Linear gradients with both vertical or horizontal orientation
---are supported.
---
---@field window_background_gradient? Gradient
---Specifies the path to a background image attachment file.
---The file can be any image format that the rust `image`
---crate is able to identify and load.
---A window background image is rendered into the background
---of the window before any other content.
---The image will be scaled to fit the window.
---
---@field window_background_image? string
---Generates a coloured background from an object of type
---[`HsbTransform`](lua://HsbTransform).
---
---@field window_background_image_hsb? HsbTransform
---Specifies the alpha value to use when rendering the window background.
---
---The background is taken either from
---[`config.window_background_image`](lua://Config.window_background_image)
---or, if there is none, the background color of the cell in the current position.
---
---The default is `1.0` which is 100% opaque.
---Setting it to a number between `0.0` and `1.0` will allow for
---the screen behind the window to _"shine through"_ to varying degrees.
---
---This only works on systems with a compositing window manager.
---
---Setting opacity to a value other than `1.0` can impact render performance.
---
---@field window_background_opacity? number
---Whether to display a confirmation prompt when the window is closed
---by the windowing environment, either because the user closed it
---with the window decorations, or instructed their window manager to do so.
---
---Set this to `"NeverPrompt"` if you don't like having to confirm closing your windows.
---
---@field window_close_confirmation? "AlwaysPrompt"|"NeverPrompt"
---Controls the alignment of the terminal cells inside the window.
---
---When the window size is not a multiple of terminal cell size,
---terminal cells will be slightly smaller than the window,
---and leave a small gap between the two.
---
---You can use this option to control where the additional gap will be.
---
---@field window_content_alignment? { horizontal: "Left"|"Center"|"Right", vertical: "Top"|"Center"|"Bottom" }
---Configures whether the window has a title bar and/or resizable border.
---
---The value is a set of flags:
---
---  - `"NONE"`: disables titlebar and border (borderless mode),
---              but causes problems with resizing and minimizing the window,
---              so you probably want to use `"RESIZE"` instead of `"NONE"`
---              if you just want to remove the title bar
---  - `"TITLE"`: disable the resizable border and enable only the title bar
---  - `"RESIZE"`: disable the title bar but enable the resizable border
---  - `"TITLE|RESIZE"`: Enable titlebar and border. This is the default
---  - `"INTEGRATED_BUTTONS|RESIZE"`: place window management buttons (minimize, maximize, close)
---                                     into the tab bar instead of showing a title bar
---  - `"MACOS_FORCE_DISABLE_SHADOW"`: (macOS only) disable the window shadow effect
---  - `"MACOS_FORCE_ENABLE_SHADOW"`: (macOS only) enable the window shadow effect
---  - `"MACOS_FORCE_SQUARE_CORNERS"`: (macOS only) force the window to have square rather than rounded corners.
---                                    It is not compatible with `"TITLE"` or `"INTEGRATED_BUTTONS"`
---  - `"MACOS_USE_BACKGROUND_COLOR_AS_TITLEBAR_COLOR"`: (macOS only) change the system titlebar background color

--- - [`WindowDecorations`](lua://WindowDecorations)
---
---@field window_decorations? WindowDecorations
---This setting is applicable primarily on Wayland systems when
---client-side decorations are in use.
---
---It allows you to customize the colors of the window frame.
---Some of these colors are used by the fancy tab bar.
---
---```lua
---config.window_frame = {
---  inactive_titlebar_bg = "#353535",
---  active_titlebar_bg = "#2b2042",
---  inactive_titlebar_fg = "#cccccc",
---  active_titlebar_fg = "#ffffff",
---  inactive_titlebar_border_bottom = "#2b2042",
---  active_titlebar_border_bottom = "#2b2042",
---  button_fg = "#cccccc",
---  button_bg = "#2b2042",
---  button_hover_fg = "#ffffff",
---  button_hover_bg = "#3b3052",
---}
---```
---
---You may explicitly add a border around the window area:
---
---```lua
---config.window_frame = {
---  border_left_width = "0.5cell",
---  border_right_width = "0.5cell",
---  border_bottom_height = "0.25cell",
---  border_top_height = "0.25cell",
---  border_left_color = "purple",
---  border_right_color = "purple",
---  border_bottom_color = "purple",
---  border_top_color = "purple",
---}
---```
---
---You may specify the font and font size for the tabbar:
---
---```lua
---config.window_frame = {
---  font = require("wezterm").font "Roboto",
---  font_size = 12,
---}
---```
---
---The default value of `font` is `Roboto`.
---The default value of `font_size` is `10pt` on Windows
---and `12pt` on other systems.
---
---For more info, see:
--- - [`WindowFrameConfig`](lua://WindowFrameConfig)
---
---@field window_frame? WindowFrameConfig
---Controls the amount of padding between the window border
---and the terminal cells.
---Padding is measured in pixels.
---
---[`config.enable_scroll_bar`](lua://Config.enable_scroll_bar)
---being set to `true` causes the value you set for right to control
---the width of the scrollbar.
---
---If you have enabled the scrollbar and have set right to `0`
---then the right padding (and thus the scrollbar width)
---will instead match the width of a cell.
---
---For more info, see:
--- - [`WindowPadding`](lua://WindowPadding)
---
---@field window_padding? WindowPadding
---Configures WSL domains.
---
---This option accepts an array of tables of type
---[`WslDomain`](lua://WslDomain).
---
---The default is a list derived from parsing the output of `wsl -l -v`.
---
---For more info about that list, and how to override it, see:
--- - [`wezterm.default_wsl_domains()`](lua://Wezterm.default_wsl_domains)
---
---@field wsl_domains? WslDomain[]
---Explicitly set the name of the IME server to which wezterm
---will connect via the `XIM` protocol when using X11 and
---setting `true` to
---[`config.use_ime`](lua://Config.use_ime).
---
---By default, this option is not set which means that wezterm
---will consider the value of the `XMODIFIERS` environment variable.
---
---If for some reason the environment isn't set up correctly,
---or you want to quickly evaluate a different input method server,
---then you could update your config to specify it explicitly:
---
---```lua
---config.xim_im_name = 'fcitx'
---```
---
---will cause wezterm to connect to `fcitx`
---regardless of the value of `XMODIFIERS`.
---
---@field xim_im_name? string
