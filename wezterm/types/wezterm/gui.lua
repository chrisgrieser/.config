---The `wezterm.gui` module exposes functions that operate on the GUI layer.
---
---The multiplexer may not be connected to a GUI, so attempting to
---resolve this module from the mux server will return `nil`.
---
---You will typically use something like:
---
---```lua
---local wezterm = require 'wezterm'
---local gui = wezterm.gui
---
---if gui then
---  -- do something that depends on the GUI layer
---end
---````
---
---@class Wezterm.Gui
local GUI = {}

---Returns a table holding the effective default set of `key_tables`.
---That is the set of keys that is used as a base
---if there was no configuration file.
---
---This is useful in cases where you want to override a
---key table assignment without replacing the entire set
---of key tables.
---
---This example shows how to add a key assignment for `Backspace`
---to `copy_mode`, without having to manually specify
---the entire key table:
---
---```lua
---local wezterm = require 'wezterm'
---local act = wezterm.action
---
---local copy_mode = nil
---
---if wezterm.gui then
---  copy_mode = wezterm.gui.default_key_tables().copy_mode
---  table.insert(
---    copy_mode,
---    { key = 'Backspace', mods = 'NONE', action = act.CopyMode 'MoveLeft' }
---  )
---end
---
---return {
---  key_tables = {
---    copy_mode = copy_mode,
---  },
---}
---```
---
---@return Key[]|{ copy_mode: Key[], search_mode: Key[] }
function GUI.default_key_tables() end

---Returns a table holding the effective default values
---for key assignments.
---That is the set of keys that is used as a base
---if there was no configuration file.
---
---@return Key[]
function GUI.default_keys() end

---Returns the list of available GPUs supported by WebGpu.
---
---[`config.webgpu_preferred_adapter`](lua://Config.webgpu_preferred_adapter)
---is useful in conjunction with this function.
---
---@return GpuInfo[]
function GUI.enumerate_gpus() end

---This function returns the appearance of the window environment.
---
---The appearance can be one of the following 4 values:
---
--- - `"Dark"`: Dark mode with predominantly dark colors
--- - `"Light"`: The normal appearance, with dark text on a light background
---            lower contrasting, text color on a dark background
--- - `"DarkHighContrast"`: Dark mode but with high contrast colors
---                       (not reported on all systems)
--- - `"LightHighContrast"`: Light mode but with high contrast colors
---                        (not reported on all systems)
---
---WezTerm is able to detect when the appearance has changed and
---will reload the configuration when that happens.
---
---@return "Dark"|"DarkHighContrast"|"Light"|"LightHighContrast"
function GUI.get_appearance() end

---Attempts to resolve a mux window to its corresponding GUI Window.
---
---This may not succeed for a couple of reasons:
---
--- - If called by the multiplexer daemon, there is no GUI,
---   so this will never succeed
--- - If the mux window is part of a workspace that is not
---   the active workspace
---
---@param window_id integer
---@return userdata
function GUI.gui_window_for_mux_window(window_id) end

---Returns an array table listing all `GUI Window` objects
---in a stable/consistent order.
---
---@return Window[]
function GUI.gui_windows() end

---Returns information about the screens connected to the system.
---
---@return GuiScreensInfo
function GUI.screens() end
