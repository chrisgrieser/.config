Instead, there are `Source` objects in `lovr.audio` that are used for audio playback.  All Source objects are backed by one of these Sounds, and multiple Sources can share a single Sound to reduce memory usage.\n\nMetadata\n---\n\nSounds hold a fixed number of frames.  Each frame contains one audio sample for each channel. The `SampleFormat` of the Sound is the data type used for each sample (floating point, integer, etc.).  The Sound has a `ChannelLayout`, representing the number of audio channels and how they map to speakers (mono, stereo, etc.).  The sample rate of the Sound indicates how many frames should be played per second.  The duration of the sound (in seconds) is the number of frames divided by the sample rate.\n\nCompression\n---\n\nSounds can be compressed.  Compressed sounds are stored compressed in memory and are decoded as they are played.  This uses a lot less memory but increases CPU usage during playback.  OGG and MP3 are compressed audio formats.  When creating a sound from a compressed format, there is an option to immediately decode it, storing it uncompressed in memory.  It can be a good idea to decode short sound effects, since they won't use very much memory even when uncompressed and it will improve CPU usage.  Compressed sounds can not be written to using `Sound:setFrames`.\n\nStreams\n---\n\nSounds can be created as a stream by passing `'stream'` as their contents when creating them. Audio frames can be written to the end of the stream, and read from the beginning.  This works well for situations where data is being generated in real time or streamed in from some other data source.\n\nSources can be backed by a stream and they'll just play whatever audio is pushed to the stream. The audio module also lets you use a stream as a \"sink\" for an audio device.  For playback devices, this works like loopback, so the mixed audio from all playing Sources will get written to the stream.  For capture devices, all the microphone input will get written to the stream. Conversion between sample formats, channel layouts, and sample rates will happen automatically.\n\nKeep in mind that streams can still only hold a fixed number of frames.  If too much data is written before it is read, older frames will start to get overwritten.  Similary, it's possible to read too much data without writing fast enough.\n\nAmbisonics\n---\n\nAmbisonic sounds can be imported from WAVs, but can not yet be played.  Sounds with a `ChannelLayout` of `ambisonic` are stored as first-order full-sphere ambisonics using the AmbiX format (ACN channel ordering and SN3D channel normalization).  The AMB format is supported for import and will automatically get converted to AmbiX.  See `lovr.data.newSound` for more info.",

The data must be mono, stereo, or 4-channel full-sphere ambisonic.  The `WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE` extension is supported.\n\nAmbisonic channel layouts are supported for import (but not yet for playback).  Ambisonic data can be loaded from WAV files.  It must be first-order full-sphere ambisonic data with 4 channels.  If the WAV has a `WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE` chunk with an `AMBISONIC_B_FORMAT` format GUID, then the data is understood as using the AMB format with Furse-Malham channel ordering and normalization.  *All other* 4-channel files are assumed to be using the AmbiX format with ACN channel ordering and SN3D normalization.

Each one of these pieces of information is called a vertex **attribute**.  A vertex attribute must have a name, a type, and a size.  Here's what the \"position\" attribute would look like as a Lua table:\n\n    { 'vPosition', 'float', 3 } -- 3 floats, one for x, y, and z\n\nEvery vertex in a Mesh must have the same set of attributes.  We call this set of attributes the **format** of the Mesh, and it's specified as a simple table of attributes.  For example, we could represent the format described above as:\n\n    {\n      { 'vPosition', 'float', 3 },\n      { 'vColor',    'byte',  4 },\n      { 'vWeight',   'int',   1 }\n    }\n\nWhen creating a Mesh, you can give it any format you want, or use the default.  The default Mesh format looks like this:\n\n    {\n      { 'lovrPosition',    'float', 3 },\n      { 'lovrNormal',      'float', 3 },\n      { 'lovrTexCoord',    'float', 2 }\n    }\n\nGreat, so why do we go through the trouble of naming everything in our vertex and saying what type and size it is?  The cool part is that we can access this data in a Shader.  We can write a vertex Shader that has `in` variables for every vertex attribute in our Mesh:\n\n    in vec3 vPosition;\n    in vec4 vColor;\n    in int vWeight;\n\n    vec4 position(mat4 projection, mat4 transform, vec4 vertex) {\n      // Here we can access the vPosition, vColor, and vWeight of each vertex in the Mesh!\n    }\n\nSpecifying custom vertex data is really powerful and is often used for lighting, animation, and more!\n\nFor more on the different data types available for the attributes, see `AttributeType`.",

Currently, compute shaders are written with raw GLSL.  There is no default compute shader, instead the `void compute();` function must be implemented.\n\nYou can use the `layout` qualifier to specify a local work group size:\n\n    layout(local_size_x = X, local_size_y = Y, local_size_z = Z) in;\n\nAnd the following built in variables can be used:\n\n    in uvec3 gl_NumWorkGroups;       // The size passed to lovr.graphics.compute\n    in uvec3 gl_WorkGroupSize;       // The local work group size\n    in uvec3 gl_WorkGroupID;         // The current global work group\n    in uvec3 gl_LocalInvocationID;   // The current local work group\n    in uvec3 gl_GlobalInvocationID;  // A unique ID combining the global and local IDs\n    in uint gl_LocalInvocationIndex; // A 1D index of the LocalInvocationID\n\nCompute shaders don't return anything but they can write data to `Texture`s or `ShaderBlock`s. To bind a texture in a way that can be written to a compute shader, declare the uniforms with a type of `image2D`, `imageCube`, etc. instead of the usual `sampler2D` or `samplerCube`.  Once a texture is bound to an image uniform, you can use the `imageLoad` and `imageStore` GLSL functions to read and write pixels in the image.  Variables in `ShaderBlock`s can be written to using assignment syntax.\n\nLÖVR handles synchronization of textures and shader blocks so there is no need to use manual memory barriers to synchronize writes to resources from compute shaders.",

          notes = "The `flags` table should contain string keys, with boolean or numeric values.  These flags can be used to customize the behavior of Shaders from Lua, by using the flags in the shader source code.  Numeric flags will be available as constants named `FLAG_<flagName>`.  Boolean flags can be used with `#ifdef` and will only be defined if the value in the Lua table was `true`.\n\nThe following flags are used by shaders provided by LÖVR:\n\n- `animated` is a boolean flag that will cause the shader to position vertices based on the pose\n  of an animated skeleton.  This should usually only be used for animated `Model`s, since it\n  needs a skeleton to work properly and is slower than normal rendering.\n- `alphaCutoff` is a numeric flag that can be used to implement simple \"cutout\" style\n  transparency, where pixels with alpha below a certain threshold will be discarded.  The value\n  of the flag should be a number between 0.0 and 1.0, representing the alpha threshold.\n- `uniformScale` is a boolean flag used for optimization.  If the Shader is only going to be\n  used with objects that have a *uniform* scale (i.e. the x, y, and z components of the scale\n  are all the same number), then this flag can be set to use a faster method to compute the\n  `lovrNormalMatrix` uniform variable.\n- `multicanvas` is a boolean flag that should be set when rendering to multiple Textures\n  attached to a `Canvas`.  When set, the fragment shader should implement the `colors` function\n  instead of the `color` function, and can write color values to the `lovrCanvas` array instead\n  of returning a single color.  Each color in the array gets written to the corresponding\n  texture attached to the canvas.\n- `highp` is a boolean flag specific to mobile GPUs that changes the default precision for\n  fragment shaders to use high precision instead of the default medium precision.  This can fix\n  visual issues caused by a lack of precision, but isn't guaranteed to be supported on some\n  lower-end systems.\n- The following flags are used only by the `standard` PBR shader:\n  - `normalMap` should be set to `true` to render objects with a normal map, providing a more\n  detailed, bumpy appearance.  Currently, this requires the model to have vertex tangents.\n  - `emissive` should be set to `true` to apply emissive maps to rendered objects.  This is\n    usually used to apply glowing lights or screens to objects, since the emissive texture is\n    not affected at all by lighting.\n  - `indirectLighting` is an *awesome* boolean flag that will apply realistic reflections and\n    lighting to the surface of an object, based on a specially-created skybox.  See the\n    `Standard Shader` guide for more information.\n  - `occlusion` is a boolean flag that uses the ambient occlusion texture in the model.  It only\n    affects indirect lighting, so it will only have an effect if the `indirectLighting` flag is\n    also enabled.\n  - `skipTonemap` is a flag that will skip the tonemapping process.  Tonemapping is an important\n    process that maps the high definition physical color values down to a 0 - 1 range for\n    display.  There are lots of different tonemapping algorithms that give different artistic\n    effects.  The default tonemapping in the standard shader is the ACES algorithm, but you can\n    use this flag to turn off ACES and use your own tonemapping.\n\nCurrently, up to 32 shader flags are supported.\n\nThe `stereo` option is only necessary for Android.  Currently on Android, only stereo shaders can be used with stereo Canvases, and mono Shaders can only be used with mono Canvases.",

They are individual objects that are garbage collected when no longer needed.  They're created using the usual `lovr.math.new<Type>` syntax:\n\n    self.position = lovr.math.newVec3(x, y, z)\n\n**Temporary** vectors are created from a shared pool of vector objects.  This makes them faster because they use temporary memory and do not need to be garbage collected.  To make a temporary vector, leave off the `new` prefix:\n\n    local position = lovr.math.vec3(x, y, z)\n\nAs a further shorthand, these vector constructors are placed on the global scope.  If you prefer to keep the global scope clean, this can be configured using the `t.math.globals` flag in `lovr.conf`.\n\n    local position = vec3(x1, y1, z1) + vec3(x2, y2, z2)\n\nTemporary vectors, with all their speed, come with an important restriction: they can only be used during the frame in which they were created.  Saving them into variables and using them later on will throw an error:\n\n    local position = vec3(1, 2, 3)\n\n    function lovr.update(dt)\n      -- Reusing a temporary vector across frames will error:\n      position:add(vec3(dt))\n    end\n\nIt's possible to overflow the temporary vector pool.  If that happens, `lovr.math.drain` can be used to periodically drain the pool, invalidating any existing temporary vectors.\n\n### Metamethods\n\nVectors have metamethods, allowing them to be used using the normal math operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.\n\n    print(vec3(2, 4, 6) * .5 + vec3(10, 20, 30))\n\nThese metamethods will create new temporary vectors.\n\n### Components and Swizzles\n\nThe raw components of a vector can be accessed like normal fields:\n\n    print(vec3(1, 2, 3).z) --> 3\n    print(mat4()[16]) --> 1\n\nAlso, multiple fields can be accessed and combined into a new (temporary) vector, called swizzling:\n\n    local position = vec3(10, 5, 1)\n    print(position.xy) --> vec2(10, 5)\n    print(position.xyy) --> vec3(10, 5, 5)\n    print(position.zyxz) --> vec4(1, 5, 10, 1)\n\nThe following fields are supported for vectors:\n\n- `x`, `y`, `z`, `w`\n- `r`, `g`, `b`, `a`\n- `s`, `t`, `p`, `q`\n\nQuaternions support `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`.\n\nMatrices use numbers for accessing individual components in \"column-major\" order.\n\nAll fields can also be assigned to.\n\n    -- Swap the components of a 2D vector\n    v.xy = v.yx\n\nThe `unpack` function can be used (on any vector type) to access all of the individual components of a vector object.  For quaternions you can choose whether you want to unpack the angle/axis representation or the raw quaternion components.  Similarly, matrices support raw unpacking as well as decomposition into translation/scale/rotation values.",
