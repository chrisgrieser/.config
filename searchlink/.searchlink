# To create custom abbreviations for Google Site Searches,
# add to (or replace) the hash below.
# "abbreviation" => "site.url",
# This allows you, for example to use [search term](!bt)
# as a shortcut to search brettterpstra.com (using a site-specific
# Google search). Keys in this list can override existing
# search trigger abbreviations.
#
# If a custom search starts with "http" or "/", it becomes
# a simple replacement. Any instance of "$term" is replaced
# with a URL-escaped version of your search terms.
# Use $term1, $term2, etc. to replace in sequence from
# multiple search terms. No instances of "$term" functions
# as a simple shortcut. "$term" followed by a "d" lowercases
# the replacement. Use "$term1d," "$term2d" to downcase
# sequential replacements (affected individually).
# Long flags (e.g. --no-validate_links) can be used after
# any url in the custom searches.
#
# Use $terms to slugify all search terms, turning
# "Markdown Service Tools" into "markdown-service-tools"
