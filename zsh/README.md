## Framework-free
- I don't use a zsh framework, since most zsh plugins are honestly little more
  than a few lines to be copypasted, see [this critique of
  oh-my-zsh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21_WkzBErQk), which I mostly agree
  with.
- `oh-my-zsh` also seems to affect performance, [increasing zsh loading time
  considerably](https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/speeding-up-zsh).
