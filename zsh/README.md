## Framework-free
- I don't use a zsh framework, since most zsh plugins are honestly little more than a few lines to be copypasted, see [this critique of oh-my-zsh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21_WkzBErQk), which I mostly agree with.
- `oh-my-zsh` also seems to affect performance quite a bit, [increasing zsh loading time considerably](https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/speeding-up-zsh).
