## Features
- Quick insertion of log statements for the variable under the cursor
  (normal mode) or the selection (visual mode).
- Smart detection of the variable under the cursor and the correct insertion
  location via Treesitter.
- Commands for a dozen different log statement types, including assert statements,
  stacktraces, or acoustic logging. All commands are dot-repeatable.
- Builtin support for ~20 common languages, with dedicated support for
  `nvim-lua`, and easy configuration for additional languages.
- Helper commands to remove all log statements created by `nvim-chainsaw` or
  to clear the console.
- Flexible templating options for customizing log statements, including
  support for multi-line templates.
- Visual indication of log statements via highlights, signcolumn, or scrollbar
  (when using [satellite.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/satellite.nvim)).

## Installation
**Requirements**
- nvim 0.10 or higher.
- Optional for [smart variable identification](#smart-variable-identification):
  Treesitter parser for the respective languages.

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{ 
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-chainsaw", 
	event = "VeryLazy",
	opts = {} -- required even if left empty
},

-- packer
use { 
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-chainsaw"
	config = function () 
		require("chainsaw").setup()
	end,
}
```

*The plugin needs to be loaded for highlights, signs, and scrollbar items to be
displayed. If you do not care about them, you can also remove the early loading
via `event = "VeryLazy"`.*

## Built-in language support
- JavaScript/TypeScript (and supersets)
- Python
- Lua (with special considerations for `nvim-lua`[^1])
- Shell (and supersets)
- AppleScript
- Ruby
- Rust
- CSS[^2] (and supersets)
- Go[^3]

Not every language supports every type of log statement. For the concrete
statements used, see
[log-statements-data.lua](./lua/chainsaw/config/log-statements-data.lua).

[^1]: `variableLog` for `nvim_lua` uses a log statement that inspects objects
	and is designed to work with various notification plugins like
	`nvim-notify`, `snacks.nvim`, or `noice.nvim`. If using `snacks.nvim`, lua
	syntax highlighting is added as well.
[^2]: Uses statements such as `outline: 2px solid red !important;` that are the
	somewhat similar logging.
[^3]: The packages `fmt` and `time` need to be imported manually.

## Usage

### List of commands
The plugin offers various types of log statements. Bind keymaps for the ones you
want to use.

All operations are dot-repeatable.

```lua
-- log the name & value of the variable under the cursor
require("chainsaw").variableLog()

-- like variableLog, but with syntax specific to inspect an object such as
-- `console.log(JSON.stringify(foobar))` in javascript
require("chainsaw").objectLog()

-- inspect the type of the variable under cursor, such as `typeof foo` in js
require("chainsaw").typeLog()

-- assertion statement for variable under cursor
require("chainsaw").assertLog()

-- Minimal log statement, with an emoji for differentiation. Intended for
-- control flow inspection, that is to quickly glance whether a condition was
-- triggered or not.
require("chainsaw").emojiLog()

-- Sound-playing statement for audible debugging.
-- Depending on the type of log statement, it is either a terminal bell
-- (requiring the terminal) or a system sound.
-- Inspired by https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41519046
require("chainsaw").sound()

-- create log statement, and position the cursor to enter a message
require("chainsaw").messageLog()

-- 1st call: start measuring the time
-- 2nd call: logs the time duration since
require("chainsaw").timeLog()

-- debug statements like `debugger` in javascript or `breakpoint()` in python
require("chainsaw").debugLog()

-- prints the stacktrace of the current call
require("chainsaw").stacktraceLog()

-- clearing statement, such as `console.clear()`
require("chainsaw").clearLog()

---------------------------------------------------

-- remove all log statements created by nvim-chainsaw
require("chainsaw").removeLogs()
```

These features can also be accessed with the user command `:Chainsaw`. Each
option corresponds to the commands above. For example, `:Chainsaw
variableLog` is same as `:lua require("chainsaw").variableLog()`.

When using lua functions, `variableLog`, `objectLog`, `typeLog`, and `assertLog`
can also be used in **visual mode** to use the visual selection instead of the
word under the cursor.

### Smart variable detection
When the variable under the cursor is an object with fields, `chainsaw` attempts
to automatically select the correct field. Note that this feature requires the
Treesitter parser of the respective language.

```lua
myVariable.myF[i]eld = "foobar"
-- prints: myVariable.myField

myVa[r]iable.myField = "foobar"
-- prints: myVariable
```

Filetypes currently supporting this feature:
- Lua (and `nvim_lua`)
- Python
- JavaScript (and supersets)

PRs adding support for more languages are welcome. See
[smart-var-detect.lua](./lua/chainsaw/config/smart-var-detect.lua).

### Smart insertion location
`chainsaw` tries to automatically detect if inserting the log statement below
the cursor would result in a syntax error, and adapts the insertion
location if needed.

```lua
-- should insert the log statement below the line with `}`
local f[o]o = {
	bar = 1
}

-- should insert the log statement above the return statement
local function foobar()
	return f[o]o
end
```

Filetypes currently supporting this feature:
- Lua (and `nvim_lua`)

PRs adding support for more languages are welcome. See
[smart-insert-location.lua](./lua/chainsaw/config/smart-insert-location.lua).

## Configuration
The `setup()` call is required.

### Base configuration

```lua
-- default settings
require("chainsaw").setup {
	-- The marker should be a unique string, since signs and highlgiths are based
	-- on it and since `.removeLogs()` will remove any line with it. Thus, emojis
	-- or unique strings like "[Chainsaw]" are recommended.
	marker = "ü™ö",

	-- Appearance of lines with the marker
	visuals = {
		sign = "Û∞πà",
		signHlgroup = "DiagnosticSignInfo",
		statuslineIcon = "Û∞πà",
		lineHlgroup = false,

		nvimSatelliteIntegration = {
			enabled = true,
			hlgroup = "DiagnosticSignInfo",
			icon = "‚ñ™",
			leftOfScrollbar = false,
			priority = 40, -- compared to other handlers (diagnostics are 50)
		},
	},

	-- configuration for specific logtypes
	logtypes = {
		emojiLog = {
			emojis = { "üîµ", "üü©", "‚≠ê", "‚≠ï", "üíú", "üî≤" },
		},
	},

	-- If a filetype has no configuration for a specific logtype, then it will
	-- look for the configuration for a superset of that filetype.
	supersets = {
		nvim_lua = "lua", -- `nvim_lua` config is used when in nvim-lua
		typescript = "javascript",
		typescriptreact = "typescript",
		javascriptreact = "javascript",
		vue = "typescript",
		svelte = "typescript",
		bash = "sh",
		zsh = "sh",
		fish = "sh",
		scss = "css",
		less = "css",
		sass = "css",
	},

	logStatements = require("chainsaw.config.log-statements-data"),
}
```

### Customize log statements
New log statements can be added, and existing log statements can be modified
under the config `logStatements`. See
[log-statements-data.lua](./lua/chainsaw/config/log-statements-data.lua) for
the built-in log statements as reference. PRs adding log statements for more
languages are welcome.

There are various **placeholders** that are dynamically replaced:
- `{{marker}}` inserts the value from `config.marker`. Each log statement should
  have one, so that the line can be removed via `.removeLogs()`.
- `{{var}}`: variable as described further above.
- `{{time}}`: timestamp formatted as `HH:MM:SS` (for millisecond-precision, use
  `.timeLog()` instead)
- `{{file}}`: basename of the current file
- `{{lnum}}`: current line number
- *`.emojiLog()` only*: `{{emoji}}` inserts the emoji
- *`.timeLog()` only*: `{{index}}` inserts a running index (needed to
  differentiate between variables when inserting `timeLog` multiple times).

```lua
require("chainsaw").setup ({
	logStatements = {
		variableLog = {
			javascript = 'console.log("{{marker}} {{var}}:", {{var}});',
			otherFiletype = ‚Ä¶ -- <-- add the statement for your filetype here
		},
		-- the same way for the other log statement operations
	},
})
```

> [!NOTE]
> The strings may not include line breaks. If you want to use multi-line log
> statements, use a list of strings instead, each string representing one line.

### Have your formatter ignore the log statements
A common problem is that formatters like `prettier` split up the log statements
into multiple lines, making them hard to read and breaking `.removeLogs()`, which
relies on each line containing the marker emoji.

The simplest method to deal with this is to customize the log statement in your
configuration to include an ignore-comment: `/* prettier-ignore */` (and add the
marker to it as well, so it is included in the removal by `.removeLogs()`.)

```lua
require("chainsaw").setup {
	logStatements = {
		variableLog = {
			javascript = {
				"/* prettier-ignore */ // {{marker}}", -- adding this
				'console.log("{{marker}} {{var}}:", {{var}});',
			},
		},
	},
}
```

### Statusline
This function returns number of log statements *by nvim-chainsaw* in the current
buffer.

```lua
require("chainsaw.visuals.statusline").countInBuffer()
```
